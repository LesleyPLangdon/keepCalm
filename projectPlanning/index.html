        <h2>Wireframes, Flowcharts, and DOM trees</h2>
        <h3>First, some definitions: </h3>
        <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="column">
            <h3>Wireframes:</h3>
            <p>A wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It
              outlines the basic layout, structure, and functionality of a project without going into specific details
              such as color schemes or specific graphics. Wireframes provide a simple way to convey the overall design
              and flow of a project, and can help ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page before moving into
              more detailed design phases. By creating wireframes, designers and developers can save time by identifying
              potential issues before they become more costly problems.</p>

            <ol>
              Steps to create a wireframe:
              <li>Determine the purpose and audience of the website</li>
              <li>Identify the main content areas and prioritize their importance</li>
              <li>Sketch out rough layouts and design concepts</li>
              <li>Choose a wireframing tool or create a template using pen and paper</li>
              <li>Add in specific content and design elements, such as navigation menus, images, and text</li>
              <li>Review and refine the wireframe with stakeholders and team members</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>Flowcharts:</h3>
            <p>A flowchart is a diagram that uses symbols and arrows to depict the sequence of steps in a process or
              workflow. Flowcharts are useful for mapping out complex processes and identifying potential bottlenecks or
              areas for improvement. By creating a flowchart, developers can gain a better understanding of the
              structure and flow of a project, and can identify potential issues or areas for optimization early on in
              the development process. Flowcharts can also help communicate the project's structure to stakeholders and
              team members.</p>

            <ol>
              Steps to create a flowchart:
              <li>Identify the main processes or activities of the system or website</li>
              <li>Determine the flow and sequence of these processes, including inputs, outputs, and decision points
              </li>
              <li>Sketch out a rough flowchart with basic shapes, such as rectangles for processes and diamonds for
                decision points</li>
              <li>Choose a flowcharting tool or create a template using pen and paper</li>
              <li>Add in specific details and elements, such as input and output data, conditions, and loops</li>
              <li>Review and refine the flowchart with stakeholders and team members</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>DOM Tree:</h3>
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. In essence, it represents
              the web page as a hierarchical tree structure, where each node represents a part of the document, such as
              an element or an attribute. The DOM provides a standardized way to access and manipulate web pages using
              programming languages such as JavaScript. By working with the DOM, developers can create dynamic and
              interactive web pages that respond to user interactions in real-time.</p>

            <ol>
              Steps to create a DOM tree:
              <li>Identify the main content areas and elements of the website, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and
                navigation menus</li>
              <li>Determine the hierarchy of these elements and how they relate to each other</li>
              <li>Sketch out a rough DOM tree with boxes representing each element and lines connecting them to show the
                relationships</li>
              <li>Choose a tool for creating a more detailed DOM tree, such as a text editor with HTML or a DOM
                visualization tool</li>
              <li>Add in specific details, such as classes, IDs, and attributes, and ensure that the tree structure is
                accurate and complete</li>
              <li>Review and refine the DOM tree with stakeholders and team members</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Why and how to use these tools:</h3>
        <p>Wireframes and flowcharts provide a way to plan out the structure and flow of a project before development
          begins, while the DOM provides a way to manipulate that structure and flow using programming languages. By
          creating wireframes and flowcharts, developers can identify potential issues and optimize the project's
          structure before it is built. Once development begins, the DOM provides a standardized way to interact with
          and manipulate the project's structure in real-time, allowing developers to create dynamic and responsive
          websites and applications more efficiently.</p>
        <p>For wireframes and flowcharts, we recommend using Google Drawings, which is a free and easy-to-use tool that
          is accessible from your Google Drive. Here's a brief tutorial on how to use it:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Google Drive and create a new document</li>
          <li>Select "Google Drawings" from the "New" menu</li>
          <li>Start creating your wireframe or flowchart by adding shapes, text, and lines</li>
          <li>Use the "Arrange" menu to change the order, alignment, and spacing of your elements</li>
          <li>Use the "Line" menu to add arrows and adjust the thickness of your lines</li>
          <li>When you're finished, save your wireframe or flowchart to your Google Drive and share it with your team
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here are some additional resources for wireframes and flowcharts:</p>

      <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
      <p>Pseudocode is a way of representing programming logic using a mixture of natural language and programming
        language-like syntax. It is not meant to be executed as code, but rather serves as a tool for planning and
        communicating the logic of a program.</p>
